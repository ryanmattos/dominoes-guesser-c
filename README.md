# dominoes-guesser-c
A C program that tries to guess if you can win your dominoes set or not, and tells you the moves you need to do to win.

# How to play
- First you need to define how many pieces you have in the first line of "jogo.txt"
- Then you have to entry with the first side of each piece, press tab and type the second side
- Each side can go from 0 to 6
- You cannot type any letters in this file (if you do, your pc dies! you've been warned)

Example:

2
4 + tab + 2
2 + tab + 0

# PS
You cannot  play with anyone here and the win condition is based only in you dominoes set. The program doesnt takes the rest of the pieces left to tell if you will win or not.

# Have Fun!
